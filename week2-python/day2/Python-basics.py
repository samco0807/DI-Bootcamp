# display fruits
print(fruits[1])

# array lent
cars.lent()

# sort a list alphabetical - not adapted when str and int at the same time
cars.sorted() 


# add an item in the list

cars.insert()


# remove an item

Given this list:


list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]


# find the value 20 in the list, and if it is present, 
# replace it with 200. Only update the first occurrence of a value


Hint : Look at the index method

print(list1[3])

list[3] = "200"

print(list1[3])


Unpack the following tuple into 4 variables


my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)

my_tuple = a, b, c, d

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)


# for i in range(11):
# #     print (i)

# number=int(input("please enter a number: "))


# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(i*number)

i=1;
print(i)
while i <= 10:
    # print(i)
    i+=1
    print(i)
