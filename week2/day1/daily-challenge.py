# Using the input function, ask the user for a string. The string must be 10 characters long.
# If it’s less than 10 characters, print a message which states “string not long enough”.
# If it’s more than 10 characters, print a message which states “string too long”.
# If it’s 10 characters, print a message which states “perfect string” and continue the exercise.
# sentence= input("Enter a sentence : ")
# count=10

# Answer :
# if len(sentence)<count:
#     print("String is too short.")

# elif len(sentence)>count:
#     print("String is too long.")
# else:
#     print("Perfect string.")

# # 2# 
# Then, print the first and last characters of the given text.

# print("The first character is :", sentence[0])
# print("The last character is :", sentence[-1])

# 3# for loop, 


# The user enters "HelloWorld"
# Then, you have to construct the string character by character
# H
# He
# Hel
# ... etc
# HelloWorld

# string=input("Enter HelloWorld: ")
# x=""

# for character in string:
#     x+=character
#     print(x)
